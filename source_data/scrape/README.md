# Scraped polling station data

This folder contains scripts to scrape and clean polling station data that was posted to the ECP website in machine-readable format.

Because they were scraped rather than hand entered, they are less likely to have data entry errors than the main data we are publishing in this repository. They also contain GPS data in some instances.

However, we do not include these data in the released polling station for two main reasons:

* These data had far more missingness than the form 28s released by the ECP
* After the release of this data on the website, changes were made to the polling stations that makes merging them to polling station results very difficult
